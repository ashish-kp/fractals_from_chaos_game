# Fractals from chaos game

## The chaos game

- An arbitrary 2D shape is selected, and a random point is drawn inside or outside the area. Every vertex of the shape is given equal weightage, and for each iteration one of the vertex is selected at random.
- The next point is drawn at half the distance between the random initial point P_i, and the selected vertex under consideration. 
- This is continued for a large number of points.
