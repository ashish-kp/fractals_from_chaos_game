# Fractals from chaos game
I was fascinated by the fractal like and intricate shapes generated by a game with "seemingly" simple rules as was shown in a Numberphile video, and wished to recreate the images in javascript, and in VPython, to understand the nuances of fractals.
## The chaos game

[Link to the Numberphile video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbKtFN71Lfs)

- An arbitrary 2D shape is selected, and a random point is drawn inside or outside the area. Every vertex of the shape is given equal weightage, and for each iteration one of the vertex is selected at random.
- The next point is drawn at half the distance between the random initial point P_i, and the selected vertex under consideration. 
  vec(P_(i + i)) = (vec(P_(i)) + vec(Random_vertex)) / 2
- This is continued for a large number of points.
The result is the following image, when the considered shape is a "fairly" normal looking triangle. This is the "Sierpinski Triangle", a triangle that contains infinite self-images of itself.

Similar images and more fascinating ones are given in this wikipedia article. [Link to Chaos game](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Chaos_game)
The same was tried for a square, but then , it turns out the rules have to be a little more complex, to obtain any such fractal images.
It is just messy looking dots, so I haven't added the image for it.
But for pentagons, the simple rules, gave a somewhat incoherent, but nevertheless, fractal like image.

### Tweaked rules
As of yet, for the pentagon game, the following additioanl rule(s) is added:
- If the randomly obtained vertex, is the same as that which was obtained in a previous iteration, then that is to be ignored, and the "dice" so to speak, must be rolled again.
For a pentagon, the following image was obtained.

These were first tried out n VPython, and the links are below:
